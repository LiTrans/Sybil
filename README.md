# A Minimax Game for Resilient-by-design Adaptive Traffic Control Systems

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) with their evolving data gathering capabilities will play a significant role in road
safety and efficiency applications supported by Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), such as Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) for
urban traffic congestion management. However, their involvement will expand the space of security vulnerabilities and create larger threat
vectors. We perform the first detailed security analysis and implementation of a new cyber-physical attack category carried out by the
network of CAVs on ITS, namely, coordinated Sybil attacks, where vehicles with forged or fake identities try to alter the data collected by
the ATSC algorithms to sabotage their decisions. Consequently, a novel, game-theoretic mitigation approach at the application layer is
proposed to minimize the impact of Sybil attacks. The devised minimax game model enables the ATSC algorithm to generate optimal
decisions under a suspected attack, improving its resilience. Extensive experimentation is performed on a traffic dataset provided by the
City of Montreeal under real-world intersection settings to evaluate the attack impact. Our results improved time loss on attacked
intersections by approximately 48.9%. Substantial benefits can be gained from the mitigation, yielding more robust control of traffic across
networked intersections.
